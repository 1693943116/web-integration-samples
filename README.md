# MyScript Web Integration Samples

In this repository, you will find **samples** of mathematical expressions handwriting recognition integration.

To do this we use our myscript-math-web component in web application (whatever the JavaScript library you are using) to bring handwriting recognition. 

It integrates all we need :

 * Signal capture,
 * Nice digital ink rendering,
 * Plug with MyScript CDK to bring Math handwriting recognition.

## How to create your own handwriting recognition sample?

You will find a quick tutorial [here](http://addresseDuTuto) to create your own Word add-in that use myscript-math-web.

The aim is to show you how is it easy to add handwriting recognition with our web component.

The word-add-in-basic-sample directory contains a basic sample Word add-in. You must arrive at this result after following our tutorial. 

## Documentation

The API Reference of myscript-math-web component used for creating our samples is available here: [https://myscript.github.io/myscript-math-web/](https://myscript.github.io/myscript-math-web/)
